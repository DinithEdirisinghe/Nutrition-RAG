Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a role in over 300 enzyme systems in the human body.
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for Magnesium is 400-420 mg daily for men and 310-320 mg for women.
Good sources of Magnesium include spinach (157 mg per cup), pumpkin seeds (156 mg per ounce), and almonds (80 mg per ounce).
Magnesium deficiency can lead to muscle cramps, mental health issues, and osteoporosis.
Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and is essential for bone growth.
The RDA for Vitamin D is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily for adults up to age 70, and 800 IU (20 mcg) for those over 70.
Unlike other vitamins, Vitamin D can be synthesized by the human body when skin is exposed to sunlight.
Fatty fish like salmon and tuna are excellent natural sources of Vitamin D.
